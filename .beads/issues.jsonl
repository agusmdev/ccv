{"id":"ccv-q6i","title":"Enhanced terminal output formatting with colors, spacing, and improved visual hierarchy","description":"## Overview\nAdd rich terminal formatting to CCV output to make it visually appealing and easier to read, similar to how Claude Code displays its output.\n\n## Visual Requirements\n\n### Colors\n- **Green**: File names, paths, success messages\n- **Yellow/Gold**: Command names, flags, variable names\n- **Cyan**: Environment variables, inline code references\n- **White/Default**: Regular text content\n- **Dim/Gray**: Line numbers, secondary info\n- **Magenta**: Function names, method references\n- **Red**: Errors, warnings\n\n### Bullet Points and Icons\n- Use filled bullet (●) for main output sections\n- Use (L) or similar for line indicators in file changes\n- Use (+) for additions, (-) for removals in diffs\n\n### Spacing and Layout\n- Proper indentation for nested content (2-4 spaces)\n- Blank lines between major sections\n- Code blocks should be clearly delineated\n- Line numbers aligned and dimmed\n\n### Code Block Formatting\n- Show file name as header (e.g., `Update(ralph-zai.sh)`)\n- Display line numbers on the left\n- Syntax highlighting for common patterns:\n  - Strings in quotes\n  - Environment variables\n  - Commands/binaries\n  - Flags and options\n- Show added lines with + prefix and green color\n- Show context lines without prefix\n\n### Structural Elements\n- Tool calls: Arrow icon with colored tool name and status\n- Thinking blocks: Distinct styling with prefix\n- Agent context: Badges showing agent type and status\n- Section separators when needed\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Dependencies\nConsider using:\n- `github.com/fatih/color` - Simple color output\n- `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss` - More advanced styling\n- Or built-in ANSI escape codes for zero dependencies\n\n### New Files/Components\n- `colors.go` - Color definitions and theme\n- `format.go` - Formatting utilities\n- Update `output.go` - Apply formatting to output\n\n### Configuration\n- Respect `NO_COLOR` environment variable\n- Auto-detect terminal color support\n- Add `--no-color` flag option\n\n### Test Considerations\n- Test with different terminal emulators\n- Test piping output (should strip colors)\n- Test with NO_COLOR=1\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Assistant text displays with proper formatting\n- [ ] Tool calls show with icons and colors\n- [ ] Code blocks display with line numbers and syntax hints\n- [ ] File paths highlighted in green\n- [ ] Commands/variables highlighted appropriately\n- [ ] Proper spacing between sections\n- [ ] Colors disabled when piping or NO_COLOR set\n- [ ] Works on macOS and Linux terminals","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"agusmdev@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T12:07:29.904553-03:00","created_by":"agusmdev","updated_at":"2026-01-20T12:11:28.51919-03:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T12:11:28.51919-03:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
